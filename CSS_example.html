<h3>Bio</h3>
<p>I grew up with a love for computers and found joy in trying to figure out how they work. I spent hours learning on Windows 95 with my grandfathers 486 Packard Bell. I began studying for A+ certification at age 13 and quickly became the IT guy
  for family and friends. As I became older, interests changed and directions changed. After placing technology to the side to pursue a career as a registered nurse, I am now rediscovering my passion in computer programming.</p>
